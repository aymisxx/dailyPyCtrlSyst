# dailyPyCtrlSyst 🕹️🐍⚙️

This repository is a daily log for revisiting control systems concepts,
implemented in Python instead of MATLAB. Each folder represents one day
of small, focused work, aimed at keeping concepts fresh through regular
implementation rather than long gaps or one-off revisions.

- The primary purpose of this repo is self-accountability.
- It exists to maintain a daily GitHub streak and, more importantly, to ensure that I show up consistently and engage with control systems every day, even if the progress on a given day is minimal.
